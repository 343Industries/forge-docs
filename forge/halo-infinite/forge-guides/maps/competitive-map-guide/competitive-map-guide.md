# Competitive Map Guide

## Map Layout and Geometry

Competitive Halo maps are designed and scaled to support and enhance high paced, team based gameplay.  

### Size

###### Gold Standard Maps for Size

- Asymmetrical - Recharge
- Symmetrical - Origin

The design of competitive Halo maps is characterized by its simplicity, avoiding an excess of structures and points of interest.  

The size and layout of a competitive Halo map should support the traits of the starting weapon.

The size and layout of the map should allow players to quickly hop back into the action after briefly traversing.

The map size should encourage players to utilize its entirety, with no areas that feel inactive or require excessive travel.

Competitive Halo maps are proportioned so that points of interest are accessible in a reasonable amount of time.

There is no specific time frame, but players should be actively in combat throughout the majority of the map. There should be limited routes that are purely for traversal.

With how much of an advantage height can be, competitive maps shouldn’t have too drastic of an elevation and verticality difference. As competitive Halo has evolved over time, maps like Prisoner (Halo 1) and Construct (Halo 3) with large areas of extreme levels of verticality have been seen as more frustrating combat loops due to the extreme height advantage paired with the Infinite sandbox (Hit scan weapons, short kill times, and greater efficiency from long ranges.)

That said, competitive Halo maps should feature multiple levels of verticality.

- Typically, areas with increased levels of vertically have a counter points of verticality. (e.g., Streets top Tram to top Tower.)

### Balance

Both symmetrical and asymmetrical maps should be as balanced as possible. Asymmetrical maps benefit from similar height advantage locations offset from each other.

- Top snipe and Top BR on Lockout

- Top Car and Pink 3 on Midship)

Similar Sandbox items should be dispersed across the map from each other.  Good examples are found in Streets

- Stalker Rifle and Repulse are offset by the Bulldog shotgun and Shroud

- Battle Rifles are offset from Top Tower and Top Tram

- Commando Rifles offset from Cafe and Subway.

Each team should have equal opportunity to obtain power items off initial spawn.  Here are examples of power items that spawn in neutral areas that are fair for teams to compete for.

- Rockets and Overshield on Empyrean

- Camo on Rechage

Traversal time, angles, route opportunities and players ability to compete for these items are close to even. Asymmetrical maps have tradeoffs as players have different angles and routes.

- Recharge has camo bottom middle and teams are given options of how to compete for it off the break. 

- Live Fire snipe top middle.

On symmetrical maps, all sandbox items should be mirrored so that each team has equal amounts of power.

- Grapple on Argyle

- BR on Aquarius

- Sniper on Empyrean

### Simplicity

Competitive maps traditionally do not have complexity in rooms or power positions. This means that areas of the map do not contain extreme amounts of depth, hiding spots, or cover. This prevents players from getting into frustrating scenarios of cat and mouse where an enemy can constantly get away or combat continuously fails to resolve. 

###### Examples of of maps with simple playspaces.

*Wizard*

*Lockout*

*Construct*

*Live Fire*

![](media/simplicity-02-livefire.avif)

*Haven*

*Eden*

*Recharge*

*Midship*

![](media/simplicity-03-midship.avif)

- Pink 3 is open and exposed to large portions of the map

- Bottom middle has pieces of geo to play around but a majority of it is exposed and not a maze.

###### Examples of maps with overly complex playspaces.

### Smooth Geometry

It is important that the map geometry is consistent and readable from a gameplay perspective.  This maintains the competitive integrity of the experience and will reduce the frustration around random variations caused by imperfections in the map.

Players should be able to consistently throw grenades without them getting caught in geo or seams on the map that alter the grenade’s intended trajectory.  This is also true for how the geometry affects player movement.  Any geometry on the map that affects traversal should be clearly readable to the player (i.e. a player should not be hitting their head on a little ledge if it is not obvious that the ledge will affect their movement).

###### Good Example

*Live Fire - Geometry allows players to determine exactly where they need to throw a grenade to bounce it into the window*

###### Example of Bad

*Solitude - Complexity of geometry makes it extremely difficult for players to know where grenade will go off of pieces like this causing gameplay to be less intentional.*

### Open Sightlines

Whether it’s a walkway connecting one room to another, a ramp/street leading to a power position, a power position that is exposed or a window/door leading into a base, it’s important that these areas have lines of sight from other areas of the map. 

Sight lines are important because this is how players obtain information of where the enemy is.  Tracking enemies locations allows for players to make an educated decision and allows for more cerebral decision making.

Take Recharge, for example. It’s normal to have room-based combat, but it is important that traversal to those rooms can be exposed so players have action they can take, ranging simply from obtaining information and relaying it to teammates, all the way to landing shots on the enemy as they try to advance to a new position.

*Red outlines indicate good, open sightlines*

![](media/sightlines-01-recharge.avif)

![](media/sightlines-02-recharge.avif)

Competitive Halo maps can vary in design while adhering to the philosophy of open lines of sight.

- Maps can be open and offer lines of sight from nearly all positions (e.g., Midship).
- Maps can be segmented but have open lines of sight in each segment (e.g., Live Fire).
- Maps can have room to room combat but connecting traversal points are exposed (e.g., Recharge).

The central area of the map has open lines of sight.

Each area should feature access points that provide lines of sight into other areas.

There are power positions which typically have the most lines of sight and give players a positional advantage.

### Flow

Cover positioned throughout the map is designed to facilitate maneuverability during combat and aid in progression from point A to B, rather than serving as prolonged hiding spots.

Good map design incorporates gradual curved openings to areas rather than sharp 90-degree turns. This is to limit chokepoints and make for a more natural discovery of enemy location while navigating into areas. For example, when entering an area players don't have to commonly inspect corners for enemy presence before proceeding.

*Both Sides of the door allow players to hide unseen*

![](media/flow-openings-01-aquarius.avif)

*The entrance of the base from pink side has a spot on the left side where players can hide.*

![](media/flow-openings-02-aquarius.avif)

Good map design allows for dynamic objective play (e.g., in CTF there isn't just one optimal way to run the flag).

Doorways should have plenty of play space to enter and exit.  Narrow doorways can cause frustration due to forcing players into an exact choke point that is easily shut down by grenades. With a bit more space in these connecting points, players are able to dodge grenades and progress on the map.

###### Examples of Good Connecting Points

![](media/connectingpoints-bad-03-recharge.avif)

### Cover

Similar to how power positions typically do not have lots of cover, areas of the map not considered high-power areas should have a bit more cover to encourage players to traverse and play in those areas. It gives players more opportunities to use the map to their benefit.

*Batteries on Recharge*

*Pillars on Live Fire*

![](media/cover-02-livefire.avif)

*Courtyard on Aquarius*

![](media/cover-03-aquarius.avif)

### Balanced Routes

A Position of interest (POI) will often see more successful combat loops when there are multiple ways to enter and escape. This creates unpredictability for both the player in the position and the player attacking the position. It’s important to find a balance, because too many access points to a POI creates chaos, rather than unpredictability. This philosophy also rings true for traditional traversal areas of a map, not just POIs. 

###### Good Examples

*Key door jump to A play grenades on Live Fire*

*Mid-bridge to top tower of Recharge*

![](media/balancedroutes-02-recharge.avif)

*Driveway ledge to Commando on Streets*

![](media/balancedroutes-03-streets.avif)

### Orientation and Navigation

Players should be able to instantly identify where they are on the map so that they can quickly decide on what to do next.

###### Good Example

*Aquarius*

The base and side colors are immediately apparent to the player and are information the player can use to help orient themselves.

###### Bad Example

*Argyle (with Dynamic Spawns)*

Due to the map pallete being more monochromatic, players can have trouble knowing exactly where they are and where the enemy might be.

On symmetrical maps bases it's key to have distinguishable colors that allow players to quickly orient themselves off respawn.

### Item Pickups

###### Power Item Quantity

The amount in play at any given time should range from medium to low (think 1-2 items per player on each team) to avoid a heavy snowball effect in case one team obtains all items at once. 

###### Power Positions on the Map

These locations should have matching risk/reward factors in terms of achieving and/or maintaining the position. High risk = high reward.

Pink 3 on Halo 2’s Midship is difficult to maintain position, but a player has line of sight over most of the map.

Top Yellow on Solitude is difficult to hold because there is no cover but it is powerful because you are able to see a majority of the map. 

A good trade off for risk in these types of positions tends to be exposure of the location. 

###### Power Weapon Spawn Locations

These items do not typically spawn in their ideal location for usage. 

Example of a bad location for a power weapon spawn:

- In Streets, the Stalker Rifle spawned top of subway in year 1 of HCS.  This allowed players to pick it up and immediately be in the prime location to use the weapon for success.

The less players need to compete to obtain a power item, the more the player should need to traverse to use the weapon in its ideal position 

Good examples of this include the Sniper spawns on Argyle and Empyrean, along with the Stalker spawn on Streets. 

###### Power Equipment and and Rocket Launcher Location

These items should spawn in neutral site locations that are exposed. Players on both teams should have equal opportunity with timings, angles and routes to grab these power ups and weapons off of the opening break of the game. 

This can encourage players/teams to advance on the map and cause engagements to occur.  The Overshield spawn on Forbidden and the Camo spawn on Streets are good examples of this.

If a power equipment cannot spawn in a neutral site due to map design, items can be placed on a 30 second spawn delay to encourage better and fair map flow before the item appears.

### Player Spawns

Spawn locations and logic should be designed to ensure fairness, balance, and enjoyment, while avoiding any substantial influence on the outcome of the match.

For symmetrical maps featuring Static spawns, players should not spawn past the “35 yard line” of their own base.  Further progressed spawns interrupt the flow and make it difficult for the opposing team to track.

Spawning players should be put in a location which allows them multiple viable options to traverse the map or re-enter combat.

The amount and locations of spawn points should give players a general idea of the quadrant of the map players will spawn in, but the exact spawn point should not be highly predictable.

Players should infrequently spawn in combat.

Players should not spawn in power positions.

Some modes on Symmetrical maps can have dynamic or static spawns.

Players should spawn in and around their base on objective modes on symmetrical maps.

Players should frequently spawn in a safe quadrant or near their team on Asymmetrical maps.
