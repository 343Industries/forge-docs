# Brute Variations

## **Ranger (brute_jumppack)**

The Brute Ranger's distinguishing factor is an enormous jetpack strapped onto his back. This jetpack isn't used for flying, but instead allows the Ranger to perform boosted jumps, significantly extending how high and far he can jump. The jetpack is used for a number of key behaviors.

- **Height** — The Ranger is designed for long range combat; ideally he will be equipped with a sniper rifle or similar and will be given a large outdoor area to snipe in. He will use his jetpack to jump to a high location, take a couple of shots at his target, and then move to another position.

- **Avoidance** — Instead of diving to the side when confronted with an immediate danger such as a grenade or a vehicle running straight at him, the Ranger will make use of his jetpack to jump to safety, either straight up or to one side.

- **Insertion** — The Ranger has the ability to use his boosted jump to cover large distances very quickly. This will result in him uncovering a target by performing a boosted jump and landing very close to his target, coming in from an unexpected vector. Designers should also try and make use of this ability to provide impressive appearances of Rangers.

- **Charging** — When berserking the Ranger will use his jetpack to jump right at the target, ending in a melee swipe that should cause considerable damage.

Because of the Ranger's ability to travel at high speeds and to otherwise inaccessible areas, he may well be the first character in an encounter that the player sees, and will likely provide information to the rest of the pack about the target's location. Taking out the Ranger early means that the player no longer has to worry about attacks from unexpected directions.

## **Tracker (brute_stalker)**

The Brute Tracker has an uncanny sense of smell, and has the ability to perform long distance, relentless searches for his target. When guarding or otherwise idle, he will be seen to periodically sniff the air or check the ground for tracks. Should he detect an enemy within a certain range, visible or not, he will alert the pack and launch a search for the target. While the Tracker is searching no other characters in that group will be searching, instead leaving the Tracker and his heightened detection skills to hunt down the target.

While searching the Tracker will sometimes pause to redetect the scent of his target, again indicated by some animation. He will relay this information to the rest of the pack, and then continue with his search. When a Tracker is present, it should be virtually impossible flank an encounter, the pack should be waiting for the target wherever they emerge from cover.

Killing the Tracker early in an encounter will be key to a player's survival. With a Tracker on their heels they will be unable to seek cover and recharge their shield for a significant amount of time, and they will be unable to surprise a group of characters and attack from the rear or a flank.
