# Halo 3 How-Tos

## Here is a collection of How-To guides. More information can be found by selecting the topic you're looking for.

### [*Build Cache Files*](../../H3/Guides/BuildCacheFiles.md)

Guide to building a cache file.

### [*Create Slip Surfaces*](../../H3/Guides/SlipSurfaces.md)

A typical Halo environment is rolling terrain with tall bounding walls. Unfortunately the slopes aren't sheer cliffs, nor do they slope upward at an even rate. All too often we discover that a player can exploit a poly or two and run, hop, or otherwise scale these slopes until they are outside of the world. To fix this we have slip surfaces.

### [*Create Soft Ceilings*](../../H3/Guides/SoftCeilings.md)

Soft ceilings are barriers of any type, not just ceilings, that will force the player (but not AIs and vehicles) in the direction of the normal of the triangle if they get past it, soft bouncing them back instead of stopping them cold like a wall.
