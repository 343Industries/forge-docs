# Modeling

Decorators have several unique quirks related to their modeling:

- The Center of the model is the origin for the decorator

- All decorators must be part of a set

- Each set can have only one material type

- All decorators in a set should have a similar number of verts

- No scaling should be present on a decorator

## Decorator Heirarchy

The general heirarchy of a decorator file for use with the decorator export script is as follows:

```
!decorator_set_name1

  b_node

    decoratorN
```

```
!decorator_set_name2

  b_node

    decoratorN
```

```
!decorator_set_nameN

  b_node

    decoratorN
```

Where decorator_set_name is the name of the decorator set and decoratorN represents any number of decorators. See Figure 1 for the heirarchy of a max file.

Figure 1 - Decorator File Heirarchy.

Each ! node will create a decorator set and render model as well as an ASS file. Though not needed, the only character that should be present on meshes is % preceding the decorator name.

## Model Orientation

Decorators can work in several ways.

Figure 2 - Model Orientation.

There are three instances of orientation. Decorators can:

- Maintain their max alignment when painted. This is most often used for decorators that need to maintain a vertical orientation, such as cat tails or hanging vines. Figure 2 shows a hanging vine. It's designed to appear to be hanging straight down affected by gravity and should not change its rotation with the surface it's placed on.

- Align themselves to the normal of whatever they are painted on. This instance is fairly common and is used for any leaf or ground coverâ€” most grasses and bushes work this way.

- Be set to "hang" against a surface. This instance is used for specialized applications such as the wire on wall decorator (see Figure 3).

## Light Sampling
