# AI

This document serves to provide an overview of what to expect from the AI in Halo 3. Various other documents linked throughout this page will give more details on specific areas of the AI.

One of the main aims of the AI in Halo 3 is to provide players with familiar encounters, but to also provide new variations on the standard encounters. In Halo and Halo 2 an encounter would involve entering a space, confronting some low level characters, killing some of them, watching them fall back, pressing the enemies, killing more, and eventually mopping everything up. In Halo 3, we introduced ways to allow designers to vary how an encounter plays by making very small changes.
