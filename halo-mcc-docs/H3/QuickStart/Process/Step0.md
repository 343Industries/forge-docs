# Quick Start Process Step 0 - Prerequisites

To pass all steps of this tutorial you will need the following:

- **Halo 3 Editing Kit (H3EK)**

- **Blender**

Halo 3 Editing Kit is available at Steam, under the **“Halo 3 Mod Tools - MCC**” title. As other games from Steam, it will be installed to the “**steamapps**” folder, i.e. its default installation path is typically something similar to “**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK**”. The precise path may vary, but you can always open its installation directory from Steam, using the Local Files feature: right-click the installed game in **LIBRARY**, select **Properties**, in the appearing window switch to **LOCAL FILES** tab, and then click **Browse**.

> [!NOTE]
> Most commands of this guide need to be launched from the folder which H3EK is installed to, e.g. from the “**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK**” by default. So, it might be a good idea to make a shortcut for this folder.

You can download and install Blender from https://www.blender.org.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use such tools as **3ds Max** and **Maya** to accomplish Step #1 and Step #2 of this tutorial and then follow other steps without changes. Please note that export settings in these tools [Step #2](./Step2.md) will be different.

If you have both H3EK and Blender, you can proceed to [Step #1: Modelling Level Geometry in 3D Tool](./Step1.md).
